# Pomodoro Timer

A simple and intuitive pomodoro timer web/desktop app - built with Vuejs, Bootstrap, Fontawesome, and Electron.

Start using the app by visiting: https://pomotimer.site/.

Download the Desktop App by visiting the website and clicking 'Download Desktop App', or you can clone this repo and build the app yourself via cli.

If you want to help extend the program or request extra features open a pull request or an issue.

A big thank you to Ashfaq Ahmed for his 'CSS Percentage Circle' [blog post](https://codeconvey.com/css-percentage-circle/). It served as the main inspiration for the percentage circle I have in the app.
