# Pomodoro Timer

A simple and intuitive pomodoro timer desktop app - built with Vuejs, Bootstrap, Fontawesome, and Electron.

Download the Desktop App by visiting the [website](https://pomotimer.site/) and clicking 'Download Desktop App', or clone this repo and build the app via cli.

If you don't want to use the desktop app, you can use it by visiting: https://pomotimer.site/.

If you want to help extend the program or request extra features open a pull request or an issue.

A big thank you to Ashfaq Ahmed for his 'CSS Percentage Circle' [blog post](https://codeconvey.com/css-percentage-circle/). It served as the main inspiration for the percentage circle I have in the app.
